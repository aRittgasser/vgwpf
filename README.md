## How to Compile

- Open `Test_cs10.sln` in Visual Studio 2010 (Need VC++ and C#). Or open `Test_cs9.sln` in VS2008.

  - Need to install the lastest version of [SWIG](http://sourceforge.net/projects/swig/files/), and add the location to PATH.
  
- Type `./build.sh` can regenerate `touchvglib/core/*.cs`.

# Add more shapes and commands

- You can use [newproj.py](https://github.com/rhcad/DemoCmds/blob/master/newproj.py) to create library project containing your own shapes and commands. So the TouchVG and TouchVGCore libraries does not require changes.

  - Checkout and enter [DemoCmds](https://github.com/rhcad/DemoCmds) directory, then type `python newproj.py YourCmds`:

     ```shell
     git clone https://github.com/rhcad/DemoCmds.git
     cd DemoCmds
     python newproj.py MyCmds
     ```
